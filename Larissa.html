      It all started with a guy who had an insatiable desire to chase the world, explore different cultures, and learn the diverse perspectives of nations. His name was Christopher de Miranda. Meanwhile, a beautiful woman named Larissa had installed an app in hopes of improving her French language skills. Little did they know that their paths were about to cross in the most unexpected way.

      One fateful day, while browsing through the app, Larissa stumbled upon Christopher's profile. Intrigued, she decided to find out more about him and stumbled upon his Instagram account. As Christopher discovered her account, he couldn't help but think, "Oh wow, she's beautiful." However, he had grown tired of constantly initiating conversations that often fizzled out within a day. So, he hesitated to make any attempt to reach out to her.

      Little did they know that destiny had other plans in store for them, and their story was just about to begin.
